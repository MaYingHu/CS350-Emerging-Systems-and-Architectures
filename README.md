# CS350-Emerging-Systems-and-Architectures

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project involved creating a prototype of a thermostat system which would allow the user to set the desired temperature and would switch the heat on if the actual temperature were below that, or off if it were above.
Milestone Three was preparatory to the final project: it required us to have the red and green LEDs cycle an SOS message in Morse code, which would be toggled with an OK message whenever a button was pressed. (The message in progress at the time the button was pressed would finish its cycle before switching.) This required the use of a general timer and the GPIO library, both of which were central to the final project.
- What did you do particularly well?
I was satisfied that all of the code for the three milestones and the final project met all of the requirements, and that the systems worked as they were intended to. I think that I also did a solid job of capturing the requirements as a state machine for each project.
- Where could you improve?
I still have quite some way to go in tightening up my code to make it more efficient, on the one hand, and more readable and maintainable, on the other. While I feel that I have made some progress on this issue during this course (in part thanks to the examples in our zyBooks course materials) there is still much room for improvement.
- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network
This course was my first real exposure to embedded systems and I think that the skills and experience I have gained will provide me with a good foundation to continue to explore this subject in future.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The concept of state machines will, I think, be especially valuable in other coding endeavours. The focus on extreme economy and efficiency was also a stimulating challenge, and could be especially applicable to writing device drivers, which is something else I have wanted to turn my hand to. 
- How did you make this project maintainable, read/able, and adaptable?
I did my best to ensure that the code was broken down into individual functions and that related data was stored together and I commented the code where appropriate. However, as noted above, this is an area where I feel I have room for improvement so I will continue to work on better organizing my code in the future.
